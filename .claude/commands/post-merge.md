# Post-Merge Cleanup Instructions

For this branch, I have merged the PR on GitHub and also deleted the branch there. Can you please pull the changes to here, delete the old branch, get me back onto main, and then prune github too. Finally confirm i am in a clean git state both here and on github. Make a nice narrow summary table.
